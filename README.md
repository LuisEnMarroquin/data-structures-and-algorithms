# Data structures and Algorithms

Some great coding challenges using JavaScript and Python


what is a binary tree
* A tree that each node has at most 2 children


## Data structures

A data structure is a data organization, management, and storage format that enables efficient access and modification.
More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.
From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure)

hash maps
linked lists
stacks
queues
trees
heaps
tries
graphs

## Algorithms

An algorithm is a finite sequence of well-defined, computer-implementable instructions, typically to solve a class of problems or to perform a computation.
Algorithms are always unambiguous and are used as specifications for performing calculations, data processing, automated reasoning, and other tasks.
From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm)

quicksort
merge sort
binary search
depth-first search
breadth-first search
