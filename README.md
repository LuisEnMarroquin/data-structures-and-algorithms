# Data structures and Algorithms

Some great coding challenges using JavaScript and Python

## Linter

Install dependencies

```shell
pip install pylint
npm install -g standard
```

Run script for all files

```shell
sh linter.sh
```

## Data structures

A data structure is a data organization, management, and storage format that enables efficient access and modification.
More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.
From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure)

### Hash maps
### Linked lists
### Stacks
### Queues

### Trees

What is a binary tree? Is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children

Files:
* binaryTree.js
* binaryTree.py

Challenge:
```
Given a binary tree, get the average value at each level of the tree

Input:

|     04     |     n1     |
|    /  \    |    /  \    |
|   07  09   |   n2  n3   |
|  /  \  \   |  /  \  \   |
| 10  02  06 | n4  n5  n6 |
|      \     |      \     |
|      06    |      n7    |
|      /     |      /     |
|     02     |     n8     |

Output: [4, 8, 6, 6, 2]
```

### Heaps
### Tries
### Graphs

## Algorithms

An algorithm is a finite sequence of well-defined, computer-implementable instructions, typically to solve a class of problems or to perform a computation.
Algorithms are always unambiguous and are used as specifications for performing calculations, data processing, automated reasoning, and other tasks.

### Quicksort
### Merge sort
### Binary search
### Depth-first search
### Breadth-first search
