# Data structures and Algorithms

Some great coding challenges using JavaScript and Python

## Linter

Install dependencies

```shell
pip install pylint
npm install -g standard
```

Run script for all files

```shell
sh linter.sh
```

## Data structures

A data structure is a data organization, management, and storage format that enables efficient access and modification.
More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.
From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure)

### Hash maps (Hash tables)

What is a Hashing algorithm? It's a calculation applied to a key to transform in to an address
* For numeric keys, divide the key by the number of available addresses and take the remainder
* For alphanumeric keys, divide the sum of ASCII codes in a key by the number of availiable addresses and take the remainder
* Folding method divides key into equal parts then adds the parts together
  * The phone number **01 452 834 5654**, becomes 01 + 45 + 28 + 34 + 56 + 54 = 218
  * Depending on size of table, may then divide by some constant and take remainder

Collision resolution
* Linear probing
* Plus 3 rehash
* Quadratic probing => (failedAttemps)Â²
* Double hashing

Objectives of Hash function
* Minimize collisions
* Uniform distribution of hash values
* Easy to calculate
* Resolve any collisions

Summary
* Hash tables are used to index large amounts of data
* Address of each key is calculated using the key itself
* Collisions are resolved with open or closed addressing
* Hashing is widely used in database indexing, compilers, caching, password authentication, and more
* Insertion, deletion and retrieval occur in constant time

* binaryTree.py

Challenge

```
Given a binary tree, get the average value at each level of the tree

Input

|     04     |     n1     |
|    /  \    |    /  \    |
|   07  09   |   n2  n3   |

## Algorithms

An algorithm is a finite sequence of well-defined, computer-implementable instructions, typically to solve a class of problems or to perform a computation.
Algorithms are always unambiguous and are used as specifications for performing calculations, data processing, automated reasoning, and other tasks.
